This project is a Java console-based Bank Management System implemented using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) without applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes for beans, inheritance, or service layers.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how core banking operations can be performed using procedural Java code combined with direct database interaction via JDBC.

The application communicates directly with a relational database (Oracle) to perform transactions such as balance inquiry and fund transfer.
